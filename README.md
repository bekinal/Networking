# Networking & Visibility Labs for SOC Analysts

This lab series highlights my hands-on experience with configuring, analyzing, and securing enterprise network infrastructure. As a future SOC Analyst, these skills allow me to **detect abnormal network behavior, identify misconfigurations**, and understand where and how attacks may occur across the network.

###  [Local Area Network Configuration](https://github.com/bekinal/Local-Area-Network-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
This lab focuses on designing and configuring a functional LAN, including switch setup, VLAN segmentation, and interconnectivity. These fundamentals help me understand **network topology and segmentation**, which is essential for detecting lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.

---

###  [Network Examination with Wireshark](https://github.com/bekinal/Network-Examination-with-Wireshark/blob/main/README.md)
Wireshark is a core tool in the SOC toolkit. This lab demonstrates my ability to **capture, filter, and interpret packet-level data** to investigate suspicious traffic and validate alerts related to protocols, IPs, and session behavior.

---

###  [Backing up Config Files and Managing the IOS](https://github.com/bekinal/Backing-Up-Config-Files-and-Managing-the-IOS/blob/main/README.md)
Backing up and managing Cisco IOS configurations ensures **network integrity and recovery** in case of incident or misconfiguration. This lab showcases my ability to maintain a secure baseline — a critical practice for incident response and change auditing.

---

### [Remote Access with SSH](https://github.com/bekinal/Remote-Access-with-SSH/blob/main/README.md)
SSH is a secure method for remote device access, and it's also commonly **targeted or abused** by attackers. This lab reinforces my understanding of **encryption, authentication**, and how to configure remote access securely — knowledge I’ll use to monitor for brute-force or unauthorized SSH access.

---

###  [Configuring IPv6 Addressing](https://github.com/bekinal/Configuring-IPv6-Addressing-/blob/main/README.md)
IPv6 is becoming more widespread, and attackers are beginning to exploit IPv6-specific weaknesses. This lab demonstrates my comfort with **IPv6 structure, addressing schemes, and subnetting**, preparing me to recognize unusual or malicious IPv6 behavior in network logs.

---

###  [Configuring & Verifying OSPFv2](https://github.com/bekinal/Configuring-and-Verifying-OSPFv2/blob/main/README.md)
OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol used in enterprise networks. Understanding its operation helps me recognize **routing anomalies, rogue advertisements**, and internal DoS attacks. This lab proves I can interpret routing table behavior and detect unusual path changes.

---

###  [Configuring NTP and Syslog](https://github.com/bekinal/Configuring-NTP-and-Syslog/blob/main/README.md)
Log integrity and accurate timestamps are critical for forensic investigations. This lab showcases my ability to configure **network-wide time synchronization (NTP)** and set up **centralized logging (Syslog)** — skills directly aligned with SIEM deployment and correlation accuracy.

---

###  [Configuring DHCPv4 on a Cisco Router](https://github.com/bekinal/Configuring-DHCPv4-on-a-Cisco-Router/blob/main/README.md)
This lab demonstrates my ability to implement **automated IP address distribution** securely and efficiently. Knowing how DHCP works under the hood helps me **spot rogue DHCP servers, IP conflicts, and suspicious client behavior** — all common blue team triage scenarios.

---

Together, these labs highlight a key SOC Analyst strength: the ability to **see the full picture of what "normal" looks like in a networked environment**, so anomalies can be detected quickly. From protocol analysis to device hardening and log centralization, each project strengthens my practical threat detection and infrastructure understanding.
